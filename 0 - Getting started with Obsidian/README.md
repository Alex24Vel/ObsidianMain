# Obsidian Basics
Why Obsidian? - Graph view helps stay on track despite constantly being redirected from documentation to documentation.

Tag what's relevant to you project/task and filter it easily in the Graph view. See [[ExampleGraphUsage.jpg]] to see how it looks like.

'#copypasted' tag - the info in the file was mostly or completely copy-pasted from the source and can be either ignored or replaced. Better to refer to the source material instead.
