## Here's what's happening:

1. C# application tries to connect to the MySQL server specified in connection string (Server=localhost;Database=yt_coding_tutorials_ef_core_p1;Username=root;Password=root;).

2. Even though you specified localhost, the MySQL server perceives the connection attempt as coming from the hostname 'x'. This can happen due to network configurations or how name resolution works on your system.

3. The MySQL server has security rules in place. By default, the root user (and often other users) is only allowed to connect from localhost (meaning, connections originating from the same machine where the MySQL server is running, via the loopback interface).

4. Since the connection appears to be coming from 'x' and not strictly localhost, the server denies the connection based on its current user grant tables.

How to Fix It (Requires MySQL Server Access):

You need to configure the MySQL server to allow the root user (or preferably, a dedicated application user) to connect from that specific host ('x') or from any host (%).

You'll need to run SQL commands on your MySQL server. You can usually do this via a command-line client (mysql) or a GUI tool like MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, DBeaver, etc., connecting as a user with permission to grant privileges (like root@localhost).

## Example SQL Commands:
Used in MySQL 8.0 CLI.
- **Option 1: Allow connection from the specific host:**
	1. Create the user for the specific host: This command tells MySQL to recognize the root user when connecting from **xx** and sets its password. If this specific user@host combination already exists, this command might give an error saying so, but that's okay.
	```SQL
	CREATE USER 'root'@'xx' IDENTIFIED BY 'root';
	```
		Replace 'root' in IDENTIFIED BY 'root' if your actual root password is different
	2. Grant the privileges: Now that the user@host is defined (or already existed), grant the necessary permissions.
	 ```SQL
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON yt_coding_tutorials_ef_core_p1.* TO 'root'@'xx';
	```
	3. Apply the changes:
	```SQL
	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
	```

- **Options 2: Allow connection from any host (Less Secure):**
```SQL
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON yt_coding_tutorials_ef_core_p1.* TO 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'root';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
	Using % allows the root user to connect from anywhere, which can be a security risk. It's generally better practice to create a specific user for your application with limited permissions and allow connections only from necessary hosts.

- **Option 3: Check bind-address (Less Likely based on error):**
In your MySQL server configuration file (my.cnf or my.ini), check the bind-address setting under the [mysqld] section. If it's set to 127.0.0.1, it restricts connections to the local machine only. Changing it to 0.0.0.0 or commenting it out allows connections from any network interface, but you still need the correct user grants (Options 1 or 2). You'd need to restart the MySQL server after changing this file.


## What was causing this and more errors:
While ServerVersion.AutoDetect(connectionString) uses the connection string to figure out the MySQL version, the subsequent .UseMySql(serverVersion) call doesn't explicitly receive the connection string itself. It seems EF Core isn't picking up the connection details correctly from just the serverVersion object in this setup.

The standard way to configure this is to pass both the connection string and the server version to UseMySql.

Correct version:
```C#
string connectionString = "Server=localhost;Database=yt_coding_tutorials_ef_core_p1;Username=root;Password=root;";
 
var serverVersion = ServerVersion.AutoDetect(connectionString);

var options = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<CodeFirstDbContext>()
            .UseMySql(connectionString, serverVersion)
            .Options;
```
