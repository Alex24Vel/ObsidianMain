A model is made up of entity classes and a context object that represents a session with the database. The [[DbContext]] object allows querying and saving data.

EF supports the following model development approaches:

- Generate a model from an existing database.
- Hand-code a model to match the database.
- Once a model is created, use [[EF Migrations]] to create a database from the model.
